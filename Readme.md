## Installation
Here is presented the setup on a Windows OS, but the procedure for a Unix system shall be the same or very close.

2. Setup a virtual environment
    On a conda terminal type:

        
        conda env create -f environment.yml
        

3. Activate the virtual environment

        
        conda activate ML_Analysis
        

4. Launch Jupyter Lab

        
        jupyter lab
        


## Data analysis pipeline

The Jupyter Notebook is ready as it is, it contains all the steps to perform the analysis.

There is a first step for the data cleansing and preparation, which should not be anything more to do.

We invite you to test another hyperparameters for the models here implemented as well different strategies for validation and metrics.
